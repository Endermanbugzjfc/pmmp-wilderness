Controversy resolution
===
In case there are disputes, please cross out the controversial section using the \~\~ syntax (but do not delete it!), then create an issue and reference the issue after the controversial text.

For example:
> This is an example. This is really an example. ~~This is not an example.~~ [_Controversy #2_](../issues/2) This is an example.
